## 🔧 Installation & Setup

1. **Move Project Code:**  
   Place the entire project folder on your **C: drive** to avoid path issues during development. 💻

2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Open a terminal in each folder and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Do this for:
   - `portal`
   - `admin`
   - `backend`
   - `driver`

3. **Update Environment Files:**  
   - **Admin Portal:**  
     In the `admin` folder, open the `.env` file and update it with your device IP or any required environment-specific variables. 🔧
   - **Driver App:**  
     In the `driver` folder, update the `.env` file similarly with your device IP. 🔄
     
   > **⚠️ Note:** These environment files are critical for network configurations. Incorrect values may cause connection issues.

4. **Important:**  
   **Do not move or modify files in other directories** as this can lead to errors. ❌

## ▶️ Running the Application

### Parent & Admin Portals

1. **Start the Development Server:**  
   Navigate to the respective folder (`portal` or `admin`) and run:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will launch the Vite development server with hot reloading. 🔥

### Backend Server

1. **Launch the API Server:**  
   In the `backend` directory, run:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
   Ensure your MongoDB instance is running and accessible. 🗄️

### Driver Mobile App (React Native)

1. **Start the Metro Bundler:**  
   From the `driver` folder, execute:
   ```bash
   npx react-native start --reset-cache
   ```
2. **Run on Android Device:**  
   Open a new terminal (still in the `driver` folder) and run:
   ```bash
   npx react-native run-android
   ```
3. **Diagnostic Command:**  
   If issues arise, run:-
   ```bash
   npx react-native doctor
   ```
   This will help diagnose environment or dependency issues. 🔍
